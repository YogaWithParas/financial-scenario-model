# financial-scenario-model

## Overview
This project is a scenario-based financial model built to support decision-making under uncertainty. 
It demonstrates how financial assumptions translate into outcomes across multiple scenarios rather than relying on a single forecast.

The model is fully assumption-driven, with all inputs clearly documented and traceable.

## What This Model Does
- Links financial assumptions to outcomes
- Compares base, upside, and downside scenarios
- Highlights which assumptions drive results most
- Supports planning and risk-aware decision-making

## How the Model Is Structured
- Assumptions are explicitly stated within the model
- Scenarios are built by changing key drivers rather than rewriting the model
- Outputs update dynamically to reflect scenario changes

## How to Use This Model
1. Review the assumptions section to understand inputs
2. Compare scenario outputs side by side
3. Observe how changes in key drivers affect results

## Intended Use
This model reflects how FP&A teams, business analysts, and decision-makers approach planning in real-world environments.

## What This Model Is Not
- Not a valuation or investment recommendation
- Not an academic exercise
- Not a prediction of future performance
